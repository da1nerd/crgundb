# gundb

This is a port of gundb written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

## Road Map

I'm shooting for a minimum viable product here without too many bells and whistles.

* [x] port gundb's [sample project](https://github.com/gundb/port)
* [ ] write a formal-ish communication [PROTOCAL.md](./PROTOCAL.md). There's stuff floating around but nothing succinct with retro ASCII illustrations.
* [ ] clean up my hacky crystal code and abstract the gun logic into some usable modules
  * [ ]  with tests
* [ ] create a gundb client
* [ ] change this repo into a crystal library instead of an app.
